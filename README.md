Can Factory Html
================

Classes for working with HTML, in particular to make it easier to test and verify HTML that has been generated by templates 

Some common use cases

Encapsulating HTML
------------------
The generic class that is mostly passed around internally is HtmlFragment. This can basically hold anything. There are a special cases for
which a more specific class is appropriate and mostly this is used to make method signatures clearer.
* HtmlDocument is a fully form and valid page. For our purposes that means it has a <head> and a <body>
* HtmlElement is a HtmlFragment that has just a single top level element, i.e. there are no siblings
* HtmlLeafElement is a single element with no children ? is this useful

Any attempt to cast to an invalid container will result in a RunTime error

Navigating Html
---------------

The HtmlFragment class supports simple navigation of the Html. It is intended for use in tests cases where the format and structure of the
HTML may vary overtime but the intent of the test case stays the same.

<p>soaidho</p>
<p>oisdhfioh</p>

<div>
    <p>soaidho</p>
    <p>oisdhfioh</p>
</div>

<p>Something</p>

There are three styles of navigation:

### Finding a single matching node

These are simple nth style, that just runs through the current set of siblings to find the first match, e.g.

+ first()           // first element
+ second()          // second element
+ last()            // the last element
+ link()            // first link (anchor)
+ link(n)           // nth link
+ h1()              // first h1 (syntactic sugar)
+ h1(n)             // nth h1 (syntactic sugar)
+ etc...            // syntactic sugar over common element types
+ element(element)  // where element is a "wild card" pattern to match against
+ element(matcher)  // the general case    .. internal api
+ element(css selector)

These will always return a HtmlNode as they match just once.

### Recursively finding a single matching node

asserter.has(".content h1").attributes({"class": "ribbon"});
asserter.has(".content h1").text("Something");
asserter.has(".content h1:first").text("Something");
asserter.has(".content h1:nth-child(6)").text("Something");

A "short circuit" recursive style that first runs the siblings and then each of their children ans stops each time it finds a match. (Note this will
find potentially find matches at multiple levels)

with(element)    // where element is a "wild card" pattern to match against
with(matcher)    // the general case

These will return an HtmlFragment with one or more siblings or null if nothing matched


A deep pattern match that finds match
